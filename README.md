# Anna-Karina-Coded-Portrait
A coded portrait of Anna Karina made in Processing (2013)

This was a fun project! It was my first experience using code to create an image. 
I chose Anna Karina as my subject as I have been inspired by her timelss beauty for ages.
I would love to see variations of this portrait in other styles!
